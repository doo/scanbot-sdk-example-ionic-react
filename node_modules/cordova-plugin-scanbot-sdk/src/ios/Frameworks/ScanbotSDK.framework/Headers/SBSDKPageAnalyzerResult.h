 * - Rotate the image to let the page orientation flip to SBSDKPageOrientationUp,
 * - Apply a rotation with the deskewAngle to remove distortion and get perfectly aligned text lines.
 * - Limit recognition languages to languages that use the analyzer results writingDirection and textlineOrder to achieve much better OCR performance.
