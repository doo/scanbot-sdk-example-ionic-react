/**
 * The view finder configuration object for a 'SBSDKBaseScannerViewController' and its subclasses.
 * Sometimes it is necessary to limit a live video frame detection or recognition to a certain rectangular area with
 * a specific aspect ratio: the region or rectangle of interest. This is where a view finder comes in.
 * It crops the video frame to that region of interest before passing it to any detector or recognizer. Usually
 * the performance of detectors/recognizers gain a benefit from it because less pixels must be processed.
 * Additionally, to guide the user, the view finder visualizes the region of interest by drawing a rectangle around
 * on the user interface.
 *
 * Since the display resp. the camera view size differs from device to device specifying the region of interest
 * in absolute screen points would require some additional calculations and therefore be inconvenient.
 * Instead a combination of aspect ratio and minimum distances to the view(screen) edges is used.
