 * using AES128 or AES256 before storing it to disk.
 *
 * When using encryption you still can access the unencrypted images in the image storage.
 * Of course, encrypted storages cannot be read without the proper encrypter being set here.
 * You are responsible for migrating image storages.
 *
 * Important: If you wish to use the SBSDKUI-wide encryption setup your encrypter before using any of the SBSDKUI-API.
 * A good place to configure it, is your AppDelegates entry point, right where the license is set.
 * Once SBSDKUI-API is used the storages are created and any change to the default encrypter is of no effect.
 *
 * For standard components, prefixed with SBSDK (without UI) the default encrypter has no effect, since there is
 * no image storage by default. You can, of course, create instances of `SBSDKKeyedImageStorage`
 * and `SBSDKIndexedImageStorage` and initialize them with an encrypter of your choice.
