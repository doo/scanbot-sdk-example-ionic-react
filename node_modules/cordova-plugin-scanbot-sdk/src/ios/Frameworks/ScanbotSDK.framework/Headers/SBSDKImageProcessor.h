/**
 * A class to process images asynchronously: the heart of the Scanbot SDK image processing module.
 * As image processing is most often consuming lots of memory
 * this class processes images on a serial queue ensuring a minimum of large images in memory.
 * Each operation reads the image from the imageURL, processes it and,
 * if outputImageURL is a valid file URL, writes the result to outputImageURL.
 * Upon completion completionHandler is called on main thread in a synchronous matter.
 * After your completionHandler finished executing the next operation is enqueued.
 * Its resultInfo dictionary contains the processed image,
 * the source image URL and the destination image URL if specified.
