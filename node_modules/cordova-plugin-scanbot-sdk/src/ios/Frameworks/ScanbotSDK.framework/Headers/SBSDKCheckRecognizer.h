 * Keep in mind, that the buffer received from the video stream is handled by the system. So in some cases it might be cleaned or changed by the system
 * before recognition occurs. You may convert the buffer to UIImage upon receiving it and use `recognizeOnImage:orientation:` function, if that is an issue.

 * @param videoOrientation The orientation of the video frame. Should be the orientation that the device currently has, not actual image orientation.
