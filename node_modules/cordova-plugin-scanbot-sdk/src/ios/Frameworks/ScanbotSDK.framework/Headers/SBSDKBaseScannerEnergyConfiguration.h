/**
 * The energy management configuration object for a 'SBSDKBaseScannerViewController' and its subclasses.
 * 'SBSDKBaseScannerViewController' and subclasses sport a customizable energy management system.
 *
 * Since detectors and recognizers running on a live video feed can put a lot of load onto the CPU and/or GPU
 * of the device, causing the battery to drain quickly and running the device hot, you can customize the energy
 * consumption using this class by configuring the rate of detections/recognitions per second in performance mode as
 * well as in energy saving mode.
 *
 * In performance mode the detectors/recognizers will be fed with a higher, configurable rate of
 * video frames per second.
 * After a certain, configurable period of inactivity the energy save mode will be engaged and the rate
 * of detections/recognitions will be reduced to a lower (configurable) rate.
 * You can also configure the time of inactivity before the automatic mode switches from performance to energy save mode.
 
 * Inactivity here means that both of the following conditions are met:
 * 1) The device did not register significant motion for this period.
 * 2) No positive detector/recognizer results have been registered during this period.
 *
 * Once in energy save mode the device can only return to performance mode if it is moved significantly or a positive
 * detection/recognition result was registered.
