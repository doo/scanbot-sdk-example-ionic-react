/**
 * Class used to extract pages from a PDF file and returns them in various ways.
 * The synchronous functions of this class are running in the same thread that they are called from, so it is up to you to control the concurrency.
 * The asynchronous functions run in a shared queue to prevent memory pressure when running multiple extractions at the same time.
 * It is recommended to use background queues in most cases.
 * Currently the flattening of the PDF document is user's responsibility. So if the document will have unflattened annotations (except signs), they will not be exported.
