/**
 * A simple frame limiter class. An object can use this class to limit the number of events fired per second.
 * E.g. A camera device captures video frames with 60 frames per second and passes them to a detector.
 * Use this class to limit the number of detector runs to a smaller value, like 20 frames per second,
 * skipping the remaining 40 frames per second. As the detector needs lots of CPU power this limit can drastically
 * reduce CPU usage and therefore saves battery.
